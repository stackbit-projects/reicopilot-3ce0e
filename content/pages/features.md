              REI Copilot allows users to link their bank accounts, so that they are able to quickly determine where their money is. This is a time-saver in and of itself. REI Copilot also aggregates this data to allow users to see their monetary outlay as a whole and know, at-a-glance, how much money is currently invested and how much money they have available to deploy to new investments.

              REI Copilot will automatically perform various calculations and generate charts and tables providing real-time insight into the most important metrics allowing accurate evaluation of a property’s performance. The statistics and diagrams are driven by Ledger data and will update automatically as new information is provided ensuring the most up-to-date information. This is one of the biggest departures from other property management spreadsheets or softwares which simply calculate the projected values instead of actual.

              A seasoned investor and personal friend once held investments in their portfolio for multiple years assuming they were making the promised 12 - 15% return. Eventually, they sat down to calculate the ROI and found out it was a mere 3.9%

After entering LedgerItems, you will be able to view actual performance of each asset based on true income and expense data. You can also type in a property’s address to the ProForma and it will generate values to assist in purchasing new assets.
