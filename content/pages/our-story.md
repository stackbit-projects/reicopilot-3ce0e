  Our Story: The "Aha" Moment
subtitle: >-
  Several years ago, I finally realized that almost everything I have been taught about finances and being successful was wrong! A very disheartening discovery to say the least, especially for someone who graduated from dental school way back in 1984. Like many of you, I was taught from an early age to work hard, make good grades, and get into a respectable college and a good job with benefits would be my reward. Those habits continued through dental school and into my orthodontic residency. Through hard work and sheer determination, I was able to build a successful orthodontic practice which has provided for a very comfortable life for me and my family. I was also taught to live on less than I make, save my money and get out of debt which I faithfully did. These disciplines can create a life of security, but they can’t provide freedom, and in the end, that’s what most of us want . . . freedom! Do you have enough money to retire? How much is enough? Do you have a plan? More importantly, do you have a date? These are the questions most of us start asking toward the end of our careers. Of course, the time to ask these questions is at the beginning!
