      Unfortunately, most of us rely on financial advisors who have had surprisingly little investment 
      education and simply “plug” your financial details into a “proprietary” formula and out comes your 
      customized plan, which looks eerily similar to most of our colleagues plans except for the numbers. 
      Sadly, regardless of the performance of your plan, these financial advisors collect fees and 
      commissions every month. Ask me how I know! Years ago, I determined that I could do just as well in 
      the stock market as the advisors to whom I had paid all of those fees and commissions for so many 
      years. To be honest, I was even a little better, especially these last few years. Then I discovered 
      the concept of passive income, where your money works for you. I immediately called my “broker” and 
      asked about the amount of passive income that my stock portfolio was creating. Now mind you, I was 
      only investing in blue-chip stocks that paid a quarterly dividend. As I mentioned, I had done quite 
      well recently so imagine my shock when the amount of passive income that my portfolio was generating 
      in the last twelve months was enough to cover our expenses and fund our lifestyle for about ONE month! 
      OMG! The financial wake up call jolted me into action and I immediately purposed to find a better way.

      <h2 className="dark:!text-white">A change in mindset</h2>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      Ever since I was a kid, I’ve hated reading. But, as an adult, I have discovered that most of the 
      successful people that I have met are voracious readers. So, like they say, “when in Rome!” One of 
      the first financial books that I read was “Rich Dad Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki. This is a must 
      read for anyone seeking to change the way they think about finances. The biggest takeaway for me 
      was that the Rich don’t work for money, they acquire assets that make money for them. This is known 
      as passive income and is the key to building wealth.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      For most of us, we must be in our practice seeing patients in order to generate income. This is 
      what Kiyosaki calls trading time for dollars. Few of us can be away from the office for more than 
      two weeks before the bottom line starts to suffer. This is the medical version of “Golden Handcuffs” 
      as we’re paid well, but we must be in the office to make money. Some of us have partners or associates 
      who can cover for emergencies and lessen the financial deficit somewhat. However, the bottom line is 
      that we must work to make money. As the economy tightens and insurance companies reimburse less and 
      less each year, we’re trading more time for fewer dollars. It’s easy to feel like the proverbial 
      hamster on the wheel. It can seem as if there is no hope!

      <h2 className="dark:!text-white">Income vs. Wealth</h2>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      Another concept that Kiyosaki introduced is the Cashflow Quadrant which qualifies the four ways 
      that people make money. In the “Employee” quadrant, you have a job. Highly compensated people can 
      be included in this category which usually also includes good benefits. In the “Self-Employment” 
      quadrant, you actually own a job. Both quadrants on the left side of the diagram offer security 
      but an employee must work to earn income, trading time for dollars. The third quadrant is the 
      Business Owner (greater than 500 employees by definition). In this quadrant, you own a system and 
      other people make money for you. The Investor is the final quadrant where your money works for you. 
      In both of the right-side quadrants, wealth is created by passive income. Since it is not necessary 
      for you to be actively working in the business, you have the freedom and the income to go where ever 
      you want and do what ever you want to do, now that’s true freedom!
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      So, the key to creating passive income and wealth which leads to financial freedom is to acquire 
      assets that can generate income. The asset that I’ve found to be the most effective in so many ways 
      is real estate.

      <h2 className="dark:!text-white">The problem with investing</h2>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      I poured most of my energy into building my practice and raising two boys with my wife. My efforts 
      paid off and we were able to pay off all of our debts and increase our savings.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      Since I owned a good job and my wife and I were disciplined enough to live on less than what we 
      earned, we were able to save a substantial amount of money. After understanding the importance and 
      the urgency of building wealth, I immediately joined a real estate investing group. Immediately 
      after I joined the group, I bought several single-family rental houses and made several hard money 
      loans to a few trusted real estate developers. And for a while I was feeling pretty good about our 
      progress toward wealth building. That is, until I started getting phone calls asking for more money. 
      All of the rental houses that we purchased required significant renovation before they would be ready 
      to rent. I got a phone call from one developer saying he needed another $18,000 more for the rehab 
      and another developer would call saying that he needed the next $15,000 for yet another rehab. To be 
      honest, I had no way of knowing if that was the right amount or not. And because I trusted them, I 
      just wrote the check. But in reality, they could have ended up charging me more than we had agreed 
      to and I wouldn’t have known it until well after the deal was completed and my accountant had looked 
      over the numbers at tax time.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      As a matter of fact, with one of my houses I found out after the fact it was $8,000 over budget 
      because the developer had actually put new windows in the house without telling me. Now while I 
      probably would have approved that upgrade, I didn’t know about it until long after the house was 
      rented. I know that I’m making excuses, but running a busy orthodontic practice and keeping up with 
      all of my real estate investments was becoming overwhelming. It definitely would have been better if 
      I had been involved with a conversation about the decision to upgrade the windows. If I had been able 
      to easily find out what the budget was and how much money I’d already given them, I would have 
      immediately known that we were “over budget” which would have prompted questions about the reason 
      why the developer was still asking for more money and I would’ve have known about the windows. But 
      you know, I was busy and I didn’t have time to stop what I was doing to find out if the amount the 
      developer was asking for was in budget. So, I just wrote the check, not a good way to run a real 
      estate investing business to say the least! At the same time, I got an email informing me that a 
      particular lending deal was closing on Monday the fifth and wanted me to verify the payoff amount. 
      I would have loved to have answered that right away. But it wasn’t that simple. As a matter of fact, 
      it was rather complicated.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      First, I had to go find the original documents, including the promissory note that outline the 
      details of the hard money loan, to find out what the interest rate was and the amount of the loan 
      was and if there were any points included or any shared equity from the sale of the investment 
      property. Then, I had to calculate my monthly and daily earnings and the length of the loan period 
      to determine the amount of money that was owed to me. After that, I had to go back and find the 
      account that coincided with this particular loan and then total up all the incoming monthly payments 
      that I had received. Once that was done, I had to subtract that amount from the anticipated total 
      income from the loan to get a payoff amount! Whew!
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      Well, you can imagine in the middle of a busy day that the process took several hours for me to get 
      the information together. And you can imagine how frustrated I was feeling. This didn’t feel like 
      passive income at all! So I started asking my real estate investing friends how they were able to 
      keep track of all of their real estate investments? Shockingly, a couple of my friends said me that 
      they weren’t really keeping up with their portfolio. Then other friends reported using spreadsheets. 
      But one was using a spreadsheet that his brother designed and another was using a spreadsheet that an 
      investor friend had given him. Of course, none of them were the same. And so I became very frustrated 
      and disillusioned with the chaotic way that people were tracking their investments. Interestingly, most 
      investors that I encounter at various real estate groups can’t tell you what the return on their 
      investment is for any of their properties!
      </p>

      <h2 className="dark:!text-white">The search for a solution</h2>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      So, I started looking on-line for software solutions to address my problem in managing my growing 
      real estate portfolio. I was amazed to find that there really isn’t much out there other than 
      someone’s favorite spread sheet. I then asked my son, who is a skilled computer programmer for Microsoft, if he 
      would make a spread sheet for my investments. He asked me about the things that I wanted to 
      accomplish and when I answered him, he informed me that I need much more than a spreadsheet could 
      provide. He told me that in order to provide all of the functionality that I wanted in managing my 
      portfolio, I would need a web-based application. Initially, when we started to developing the app, 
      we thought it was going to be easy, but the more questions I answered and the more information that 
      I gave him, we quickly realized this was going to be a much more complex and time intensive solution 
      than we had anticipated. So, we decided right then and there that we would not only help solve my 
      problems with real estate investing, but we would be on a mission to help other frustrated and 
      confused real estate investors as well. Our goal would be to put the “Passive” back in passive 
      income because it has become clear to me that most real estate investors have no idea what their 
      numbers are! And that became the impetus for developing our interactive, real-time real estate 
      portfolio management software called REI Copilot. When we first started, I mapped out all of the 
      features and functionality necessary to accurately and passively manage the complexities of a 
      real estate investment portfolio. Through our collaboration, we have been able to create an 
      amazing software tool! As so many real estate investors have commented, “there’s nothing out 
      there like REI Copilot! This comprehensive real estate portfolio management software not only 
      stores all of the necessary documents and contacts in one place, but an investor is able to track 
      the performance of their entire portfolio as well as asset classes and even individual assets on 
      their smartphone or desktop. And that’s just the beginning! An automated alert system will inform 
      a user when a rent is overdue or when real estate taxes need to be paid and so much more!
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
      REI Copilot gives real estate investors an assurance not possible with a spread sheet and with 
      much less effort. With REI Copilot, a real estate investor will have the confidence that comes 
      with KNOWING their numbers and the FREEDOM every investor seeks through truly passive income!
